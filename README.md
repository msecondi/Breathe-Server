# Breathe
*Being human isn’t just biology. It’s a practice.*

## Overview

**Breathe** is a calming, human-centered platform that draws attention to the modern epidemic of loneliness and disconnection. It offers an interactive, reflective space for users to slow down, process their emotions, and reconnect with what it means to be human. Whether through anonymous emotional release, reflective journaling, or absorbing meaningful quotes and stories, the platform serves as a gentle reminder that humanity still exists—and we can still find it within ourselves and one another.

## Problem Space

In an ever-evolving world, modern life moves fast. In chasing efficiency, the nature of being human has been numbed. We're constantly being notified, stressing to hit deadlines, curating personas, striving for the next goal. It’s become normalized to get caught in survival or status mode, constantly comparing, reacting, and consuming.

We scroll more than we sit in silence. We talk more online than face to face. We value productivity over presence. This web app serves as a reminder to slow down, 'smell the roses', sit with our thoughts, and better attune ourselves to the human experience.
